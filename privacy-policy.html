<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension (“Extension”) handles user data while providing
AI-powered website summarization, link extraction, and query-based assistance.

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The Extension collects the following information <strong>only when a user actively interacts with it</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Current tab URL</strong> – The URL of the website the user has opened.</li>
  <li><strong>Website content & links</strong> – The Extension fetches the visible content and hyperlinks from the webpage for the sole purpose of generating answers.</li>
  <li><strong>User queries</strong> – The questions the user types into the Extension.</li>
</ul>

<p>No other personal data is collected.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
<p>The collected data is used <strong>strictly to provide the features of the Extension</strong>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Processing the current webpage and extracting its content</li>
  <li>Analyzing links found on the page</li>
  <li>Answering user questions related to the website</li>
  <li>Displaying reference links from the processed content</li>
</ul>

<p>The data is temporarily sent to our server at <strong>https://gemini-react-chatbot.onrender.com</strong> to generate responses using Google Gemini AI.</p>

<h2>3. No Data Storage</h2>
<p>
We <strong>do not store</strong> any URLs, website content, user queries, or personal data on our servers or databases.
All processing is done temporarily and discarded immediately after generating the answer.

  <li><strong>scripting / host permissions</strong> – Only to read content from the active website for processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>These permissions are used <strong>solely for the core functionality of the Extension</strong>.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>

All data exchanged between the Extension and our backend API is transmitted using
<strong>HTTPS encryption</strong> to protect user privacy.
